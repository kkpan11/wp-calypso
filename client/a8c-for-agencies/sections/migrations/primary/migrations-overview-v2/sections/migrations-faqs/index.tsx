				'Sites are migrated by moving a copy onto our servers. During this process, the existing site remains live at your previous host. Once the migration is complete, the domain is pointed to the version of the site on our servers. There can be minimal interruption while the DNS propagates, but normally, your visitors will experience no downtime. For e-commerce sites, we coordinate with you on a migration window during which the site can be placed into maintenance mode. This prevents orders from being created across the two sites. This is optional but recommended and typically lasts just a couple of hours.'
